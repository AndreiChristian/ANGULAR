### Directives

There are two types of directives: attribute and structural directives.

#### Attribute Directives

They are called like this because they sit on HTML elements just like normal atributes. (ex: ngClass, ngStyle)

#### Structural Directives

They are called structural because they can affect the structure of the DOM. (ex: ngFor, ngIf)
Important Note! We cannot have more than one structural directive on one element. For example, `ngFor` and `ngIf` together would not work.
